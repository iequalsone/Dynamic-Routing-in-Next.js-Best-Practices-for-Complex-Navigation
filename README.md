# Dynamic Routing in Next.js: Best Practices for Complex Navigation

This repository contains code examples that demonstrate best practices for implementing dynamic routing in Next.js applications, especially when dealing with complex navigation scenarios. These examples accompany the [LinkedIn article on Dynamic Routing in Next.js](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dynamic-routing-nextjs-best-practices-complex-jon-howard-y6ete/), which provides a detailed explanation and guide for creating powerful and flexible routing structures in Next.js projects.

## Overview

Navigating through complex Next.js applications requires effective routing strategies. This repository aims to illustrate how you can leverage dynamic routing to manage complex URL structures, improve maintainability, and provide an enhanced user experience. It includes:

- Dynamic segment handling
- Nested routes
- Best practices for maintaining clean and readable code
- Examples demonstrating when to use client-side vs server-side routing

# Usage Examples
## Dynamic Route Example
In `pages/blog/[slug].js`, the dynamic routing allows you to create blog pages based on the `slug` parameter. You can add new blog entries simply by adding a new file or data source with a unique slug.

## Handling Fallback Routes
This example also demonstrates how to use `getStaticPaths` with the `fallback` option, ensuring that the user experience remains smooth even when visiting a non-pre-generated page.
